# Norm Grotesk

Norm Grotesk is an open source workhorse typeface by PuzzylPiece. It takes the unfiltered Swiss aura of Akzidenz-Grotesk Halbfett and modernizes it for the digital age. It's completey free under the OFL-1.1 license.

**At the moment it's still in a pre-alpha state so I don't really have much to say apart from like... maybe *NOT* using it in any projects yet.**

## About

I'm PuzzylPiece, I'm considered a jack of all trades when it comes to graphics, seeing as I can do art, graphic design, and even type design.

## Building

Fonts are built automatically by GitHub Actions - take a look in the "Actions" tab for the latest build.

If you want to build fonts manually on your own computer:

- `make build` will produce font files.
- `make test` will run [FontBakery](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery)'s quality assurance tests.
- `make proof` will generate HTML proof files.
